# car-exchange
It's a web application for car exchanging. While programming I learned how to use Spring and Vaadin to create an secured app that uses database and provide responsive GUI.  

**Functionality:** 
- Registration 
- Login
- Add/delete/remove cars
- Finding cars and showing owner details 
- Responsiveness 

**You can try this app on heroku:**
